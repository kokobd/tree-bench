/**
 * A word, obeying the following specification:
 * <blockquote>
 * A word is defined as a sequence of letters, together with
 * apostrophes (â€™) and hyphens (-), provided that the apostrophe or
 * hyphen is both immediately preceded and followed by a letter.
 * Uppercase and lowercase letters should be regarded as the same
 * (by translating all letters into either uppercase or lowercase,
 * as you prefer). A word is to be truncated to its first 20
 * characters (that is, only 20 characters are to be stored in the
 * data structure) but words longer than 20 characters may appear
 * in the text. Non-alphabetic characters (such as digits, blanks,
 * punctuation marks, control characters) may appear in the text file.
 * The appearance of any of these terminates a word, and the next
 * word begins only when a letter appears.
 * </blockquote>
